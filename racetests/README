Prerequisites:
1)JDK
2)JCS CLI 

Steps:
1)source openrc
2)javac RaceTestRunner.java
3)java RaceTestRunner

* RaceTestRunner.java file reads the test cases from racetestcases.txt file and runs them.
Each line should contain the pair of tests that you want to run racily.
As part of the setup for each pair, a volume is created(status became 'available') and then the pair of tests in each line are run in quick succession to simulate a race.
As part of cleanup for each pair, volumes and snapshots are deleted.

* The first line of the file should contain the size of the volume to be created during setup, and the number of times you want the test-pair to be repeated. This count helps in repetition as races aren't easily reproduced in a run or two.

* You could also override the way the volume gets created by specifying the size("UseSize=10) or UseSnapshotId, at each test-pair line. If "UseSnapshotId" is specified, as part of setup a volume is created and and a snapshot is created out of that volume and a volume is restored from that snapshot and used for the test pair.

* If CreateVolume is part of the test-pair, then no volume is created as part of setup.

NOTE: 
Below are the supported operations for this test runner:
1)CreateVolume
2)CreateVolume from snapshot
3)CreateSnapshot
4)DeleteVolume

Yet to be supported:
1)AttachVolume
2)DetachVolume
